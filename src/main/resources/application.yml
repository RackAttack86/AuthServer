    application:
        name: authserver

        url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/authserver

        hibernate:
            ddl-auto: validate  # IMPORTANT: validate, never update/create
        properties:
            hibernate:
                dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
        show-sql: true        # helpful during development
    flyway:
        enabled: true
        locations: classpath:db/migration

server:
    port: 9000  # avoid 8080, your resource server will use that later

    #Why `ddl-auto: validate`?** Because Flyway owns the schema. If you set this to `update`, Hibernate will silently modify your tables when entities change, and your Flyway migrations will drift out of sync. `validate` means the app won't even start if your entities don't match the schema — fail fast.

    #Why port 9000?** Convention. Authorization servers and resource servers are separate applications. In Phase 7, you'll build a resource server on port 8080. Keeping them on different ports now avoids confusion later.
